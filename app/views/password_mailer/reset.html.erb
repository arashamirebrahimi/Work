Hi <%= params[:user].email %>

Someone requested a reset of your password

if this was you, click the link to reset your life....nah im joking its for the password...this deal will expire in 15 minutes 

<%= link_to "Reset Password", password_reset_edit_url(token: @token) %>
<!-- In mailers have to add _url instead of path
  There is no link to in text version cause its not a html file 
  
  
  this will result in an error of missing template if you not go to config/environments/development.rb
  
  and not add this line to it :
  
  config.action_mailer.default_url_options = { host: "localhost:3000"}-->
